Banking online or by phone allows you to make banking transactions such as transferring money, paying a bill, checking your balance or setting up a regular payment on your bank or building society’s secure website. Online banking is accessible via a computer or a mobile phone. Also known as internet banking.

You can make a range of payments: such as paying utility, tax and credit cards; bills; make one-off payments to other individuals, small businesses or tradesmen; and make transfers to other bank accounts or savings accounts.

You will need to speak to your bank to get set up to use their phone or internet banking service.
You will need the name, sort code and account details of the company/or person you want to pay. You will also be asked to provide a reference so that the person or company receiving the number knows what the payment is for.

Although different banks will structure their websites in different ways when making a payment you are likely to be asked to select the recipient from a list of previous payees (or recipients) or to input a new payee’s details (and there may be additional security checks before you can add a new recipient). You’ll then be asked to enter the amount you want to pay, and to re-verify that the amount is correct. Your payment will be confirmed.
